### Detecting_Proteins_and Biological_Functions_in_Prioritized_Communities
Code that is used to anzlyze the results from CoDA (https://github.com/snap-stanford/snap/tree/master/examples/coda) and CRank (https://github.com/mims-harvard/crank) to count the frequency of the top proteins and biological functions of the candidates in the highly prioritized commounities in the multoscale interactome network (CRank>80%).

### using_the_multiscale_interactome
Code that is used to run the multiscale interactome network (https://github.com/snap-stanford/multiscale-interactome) and analyzing the resutls for acute myeloid leukemia.
